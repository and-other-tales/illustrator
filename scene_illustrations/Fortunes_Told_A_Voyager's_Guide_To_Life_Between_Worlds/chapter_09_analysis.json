Its wrought-iron frame carved dark configurations against the churning clouds, a stark silhouette simultaneously familiar and utterly wrong. Lukas felt a chill run through him—the structure reminded him of a marketing mock-up he’d once created for an album release, where he’d distorted London landmarks to evoke primal fear. But this was no digital manipulation; the real thing loomed before him, visceral and threatening. Unlike the smooth, mechanical precision of the real London Eye, this version moved with a lurching, painful rhythm, each rotation grinding backward against time itself, metal screaming against metal reminiscent of the death throes of some primordial beast.\nLukas stood on Westminster Bridge, alone save for Tonto’s steadfast presence at his feet. The tortoise pressed against his ankle, a silent reassurance in this world where nothing else could be trusted. Above them, the sky of Arcanum was a canvas of unfathomable colours—deep purples that absorbed light, blues that made Lukas’s eyes water, and a sickly green that evoked both decay and rebirth simultaneously. The Thames below reflected this alien firmament, its waters flowing in directions that defied natural law, sometimes splitting into multiple streams that ignored gravity entirely. Occasional ripples spread outward not from falling objects but from thoughts themselves, as if the river were listening, responding to unspoken doubts.\n“I don’t know if I can do this any more, old friend,” Lukas murmured, his voice barely audible above the river’s unnatural babbling. The weight of his journey through Arcanum pressed down upon him—each betrayal, each danger, each moment of wonder and horror had taken its toll. Exhaustion crept through his bones comparable to a slow poison. “Maybe this is where our story ends… trapped between worlds, belonging to neither.”\nHe leaned against the cold stone railing, its rough texture shifting slightly beneath his palms, never quite maintaining the same configuration. Even this simple point of contact couldn’t be trusted in Arcanum. The bridge stretched before and behind him, but its length changed with each blink, sometimes extending into unfathomable distance, sometimes contracting until the banks appeared mere steps away.\nMemories flashed through his mind—the fateful card reading that had started it all, the moment London began to transform around him, his friends twisting into archetypes of themselves. The Fool dancing geometric figures beyond comprehension in Covent Garden. The Magician’s betrayal in his nightclub of illusions. The Devil—Peter, he’d begun to think of him, giving the entity a name made him seem more approachable, more human somehow—always waiting, always watching, wearing James’s face equivalent to a poorly fitted mask. Sometimes, in unguarded moments, Lukas caught glimpses of something surprisingly vulnerable in those borrowed features—a loneliness that conveyed both ancient and profound before the mask of confident malice slipped back into place. Peter’s eyes would occasionally drift toward the horizon, as if searching for something forever lost to him.\n“How do we fight something that can reshape reality itself?” he asked, not expecting an answer. “How do I lead anyone when I can barely find my own way?” The question hung in the air, heavy with the desperation of a man reaching his breaking point.\nNavigating Arcanum’s treacherous landscape had worn him down. Each victory had come at a cost, each step forward had been met with fresh horror.\nTonto nudged his ankle again, more insistently this time. The tortoise’s wisdom-filled eyes gazed upward, not at Lukas but at the swirling sky above. Following that steady gaze, Lukas watched as the clouds began to move with deliberate purpose, coalescing into shapes that defied conventional understanding.\nFirst came a face formed of moonlight and shadow—familiar yet transformed. The barista from the café on the corner, now rendered in celestial glory as The Moon. Her features, crafted from silver-lined clouds and patches of night sky, possessed a liquid grace that transcended physics. Yet beneath this ethereal visage, Lukas glimpsed flashes of her human expression—the same concentrated furrow of her brow that appeared when she steamed milk with perfect precision. Her eyes were craters filled with boundless depth, and when she moved, ripples spread through the heavens equivalent to stones dropped in still water. In the brief moments when The Moon’s light dimmed, her human consciousness appeared to surface more fully—her tired eyes reflecting the early mornings at the café, her quick hands that once crafted intricate latte art now weaving arrangements of starlight.\n“Your journey has been long, and arduous,” came a voice that appeared to emanate from everywhere and nowhere, carried on a breeze that smelled of midnight gardens and distant seas. “But the path ahead holds both peril and profound revelation.”\nThe clouds shifted again, darkness giving way to radiant light as The Sun took shape against the eastern horizon. His face, forged from early dawn and blazing gold, was that of Mr. Henderson, the proprietor of Kennington Park Road’s finest greasy spoon café, transformed into something primeval and powerful. For a brief moment, the same laugh lines that appeared when he’d handed Lukas his morning takeaway coffee emerged through the celestial visage—a glimpse of the human within the archetype. Henderson’s characteristic humming as he crafted latte art became the resonant hum of solar flares, his welcoming smile transformed into the majestic movement of a celestial body. When the solar brilliance occasionally dimmed, Henderson’s human mannerisms would assert themselves more clearly—that habit of adjusting the cloth apron that no longer existed, his tendency to rock on his heels when speaking. Rays of actual warmth cut through the pre-dawn chill, carrying with them the scent of sun-baked earth and summer meadows.\n“No need for such gloom!” The Sun’s voice boomed across the Thames, momentarily silencing the river’s chaotic babbling. “Stand tall, Lukas. Your burdens may be heavy, but your strength is greater still.”\nBetween The Moon and Sun, the very stars themselves began to shift, forming constellations that had never existed on Earth. They arranged themselves into the unmistakable form of Katie, the once-harried tax consultant from his building, now rendered as The Star. Her celestial body was composed of pinpricks of light that left trailing after-images across the night sky, creating the impression of multiple versions of herself existing simultaneously. Katie’s human essence manifested in the way those stars arranged themselves—her nervous energy that once had her tapping her pen during meetings now appeared as vibrating photospheres of starlight around her form. When cosmic radiation momentarily subsided, Katie’s quick, analytical mind showed through in the precise geometric arrangements her stars formed, her human gestures translated into astral movements.\nLukas remembered how Katie had once praised a minimalist album cover he’d designed—‘Sometimes less is more,’ she’d said, unknowingly echoing the exact brief he’d been given for that avant-garde music production. Now she embodied that principle perfectly, her essence distilled to essential points of light, saying more through suggestion than any explicit detail ever could.\n“The Wheel turns,” The Star’s voice chimed akin to distant bells, each word creating ripples of light that spread outward through the heavens. “And with it, the fabric of what you perceive as reality unwinds.”\nEach celestial vision was both beautiful and terrifying—familiar faces transformed into cosmic forces, yet still carrying traces of the people he had known in his ordinary life. They hovered above the river, their combined radiance casting the bridge in light that conveyed penetration beyond merely the physical darkness.\nLukas stood transfixed, caught between wonder and despair. These celestial visions were beautiful beyond words, yet their very existence reminded him how far he was from the normal world he’d once known, the London of routine and logic and predictable physics that now felt equivalent to a half-forgotten dream.\nFor years, he’d crafted marketing copy that promised transcendence—for albums, films, experiences—straining language to evoke what couldn’t be captured in words. Now, faced with actual transcendence, he realised how hollow those carefully constructed phrases had been. How could he possibly describe the Thames flowing in two directions simultaneously? What tag line could capture the sensation of standing before beings composed of starlight and memory? This experience existed in the spaces between words, in the gaps his professional vocabulary couldn’t bridge.\n“Why show yourselves now?” he asked, his voice stronger than he expected. “Where were you when I was lost? When I was betrayed? When everything I thought I knew turned to lies?” The accusation hung in the air, raw with the accumulated pain of his journey.\nThe celestial Arcana exchanged glances, a silent communication passing between their radiant forms. The Star’s constellation shifted, her stellar face showing something akin to compassion.\n“We have always been here, Lukas. In the configurations of light and shadow, in the spaces between moments. But understanding comes only when one is ready to see.”\n“Ready?” Lukas laughed, a bitter sound that echoed strangely across the water. “I’ve been fighting to survive since I got here! I’ve watched my friends transform into strangers. I’ve been hunted, betrayed, tempted…” His voice cracked with emotion. “What else did I need to endure to be ‘ready’?”\nThe Moon’s silver face rippled comparable to water disturbed by wind. “Look beyond what merely is, to what could be. To what must be.”\nAs she spoke, the surface of the Thames below began to change. No longer merely reflecting the unfathomable sky, it now showed visions of its own—a network of glowing strands that connected different points in London, pulsing with light. Some bright and vibrant, others dark and throbbing with sinister energy. Each strand whispered its own story, its own potential future.\n“Each thread represents a path,” The Moon explained, her words leaving trails of silver frost in the air. “Some lead to shadows, others to enlightenment. But all are equally valid. All are real, in their own way.”\nLukas stared down at this liquid tapestry of possibility, overwhelmed by the multitude of choices, the weight of potential consequences. Tonto pressed more firmly against his leg, a steady, grounding pressure among these ethereal visions.\n“I don’t understand,” he whispered, his voice small against the vastness of the revelation before him. “What am I supposed to see?”\nThe Sun’s golden face expanded across the horizon, his warmth reaching Lukas comparable to an embrace. “You have confronted the Devil’s darkness. You have seen the shadows that lurk in others. But have you truly seen the light that resides within yourself?”\nThere was something else in The Sun’s voice, a subtle undercurrent of… pity? Or perhaps a warning. As he spoke, the waters of the Thames stilled into a perfect mirror, reflecting not the unfathomable sky but Lukas himself. Yet the reflection showed him transformed—standing tall, wreathed in a gentle golden aura, radiating a quiet, inner confidence. This wasn’t the Lukas who had stumbled through Arcanum, lost and afraid. This was… something more. A potential he hadn’t dared acknowledge.\n“This is how we perceive you,” The Sun said, his voice softer now, more intimate. The light around Lukas fractured into motes that swirled akin to fireflies, each one carrying fragmented images of possible futures. “A beacon of potential. A nexus of possibilities.”\n“I… I don’t understand,” Lukas stammered, his voice barely a whisper against the renewed babbling of the Thames. “I’m just… me.”\nThe Star’s laughter cascaded down from the heavens, a sound akin to the chiming of celestial bells that sent ripples through the fabric of reality itself. New constellations blossomed in her wake, configurations of light that had never been seen by human eyes.\n“Just you? My dear boy, there is no ‘just’ about any living soul. You carry within you the same spark that ignites the stars themselves. The same potential for creation and destruction.”\nHer words struck something deep within him, a truth he had been running from since his first steps into Arcanum. He had been so focused on survival, on finding his way home, that he’d never truly acknowledged the transformation taking place within himself.\n“Your career,” interjected The Moon, her silvery form shifting above the river, “it always sought to shape how others see the world.” Her voice carried a hypnotic quality that made Lukas’s skin prickle. “That gift is what makes you dangerous to Peter… and valuable to Arcanum.”\nThe London Eye continued its backward rotation, each turn grinding against time itself. With each revolution, the city around them changed and shifted. This was Arcanum at its most fluid, reality itself becoming malleable. Buildings stretched and contracted, streets folded in on themselves, and the boundaries between what was and what could be blurred into something undistinguishable.\nThe Moon’s voice grew more serious, her words crystallising in the air comparable to frost. “Peter offers power, but it comes at a terrible price. A corruption of the soul, a twisting of purpose. He was not always as you see him now. Once, he too understood the delicate balance of worlds, but his yearning for certainty, for absolute control, led him down darker paths.” She paused. “We do not know his ultimate aim, only that it involves unravelling the threads of order, of cohesion.”\nShe paused, her silvery gaze conveying direct focus on Lukas despite the unfathomable distance. The temperature around him dropped suddenly, and shadows danced across the bridge with new purpose.\n“We offer understanding. Truth. The ability to see the universe, and your place within it, with clarity. The choice, as always, is yours.”\nThe words resonated with Lukas in a way nothing else had since entering this twisted realm. In all his encounters—with The Fool’s chaotic energy, The Magician’s seductive illusions, even Peter’s tempting promises—he had been reacting, surviving. Now these celestial beings were offering him something different. Not power over others, but insight into himself.\nBut now, through Arcanum’s lens, he could see a deeper truth in his work—configurations he had sensed without fully understanding.\nLukas bent down to reassure Tonto, who nuzzled his head into his hand, a small, insistent gesture. The tortoise’s weathered shell appeared to reflect both starlight and shadow, a perfect balance of opposing forces. And in that moment, something clicked into place within Lukas’s mind. It wasn’t about choosing between two worlds, between magic and mundane. It was about integrating both, seeing the extraordinary within the ordinary, accepting the full spectrum of existence.\n“I choose… to see,” Lukas said, his voice firm, gaining strength with each word. The knot in his stomach began to unwind, replaced by a growing sense of purpose. “To see both worlds as they are. The beauty and the horror. The light and the shadow. To embrace it all.”\nThe celestial figures appeared to exchange a look of quiet satisfaction. A silent acknowledgment passed between them, causing the very air to vibrate with potential.\n“Then your understanding truly begins,” they said in unison, their voices blending together in a chord that resonated deep within Lukas’s soul.\nThe Thames below erupted in a swirling vortex of images—potential futures both terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. Lukas saw himself leading a resistance through the twisted streets of Arcanum, saw battles fought with both magic and conviction. He witnessed moments of triumph and devastating loss, of love found and sacrificed, of creation and destruction intertwined.\nThe Star’s constellation pulsed brighter, her presence causing the visions to shimmer and dance. “Each possibility is real,” she explained, her words trailing stardust as they floated down. “Each choice creates new threads in the tapestry of existence.”\nThe stars rearranged themselves, forming ghostly images of different versions of Lukas, each walking a different path.\nThe Moon’s silver face rippled, and her reflected light coalesced upon the water’s surface into a map of London—both versions superimposed. “Peter’s influence grows stronger,” she warned, her voice carrying the chill of winter nights. Dark tendrils spread across the ethereal map, corrupting and twisting everything they touched. “He seeks to merge the worlds, but in a way that would destroy both.”\nOn the liquid map, Lukas watched as familiar landmarks darkened, their forms twisting into nightmarish versions of themselves. Westminster Abbey’s spires curved resembling claws reaching for the sky; Trafalgar Square became a whirlpool of shadows where statues wept black tears.\n“But where there is darkness, there must also be light,” The Sun interjected, his golden radiance pushing back the encroaching shadows. “And you, Lukas, have begun to understand the true nature of power.” His warm light focused on Tonto. “Your companion has known this all along.”\nThe tortoise’s wisdom-filled eyes contained centuries of knowledge, reflecting both starlight and shadow. His presence had been constant throughout Lukas’s journey, a steady anchor in a world of shifting realities.Then, something new began to happen. The celestial images wavered slightly, and through their translucent forms, Lukas glimpsed other figures—the real people beneath the Arcana. For a moment, Katie’s human features showed through The Star’s constellation, her familiar worried frown visible as she appeared to struggle against the archetype’s cosmic power. The café owner’s cheerful smile broke through The Sun’s radiance, his eyes widening in confusion as if suddenly aware of his imprisonment. The barista’s tired eyes peered through The Moon’s silver face, her expression one of bewildered recognition. They conveyed confusion, fear, loss—human souls trapped within archetypal configurations, conscious of their entrapment yet unable to break free of the cosmic roles they now embodied.\n“They’re still in there,” Lukas breathed. “All of them—not just echoes or projections. The real people are trapped inside the Arcana.”\nThe celestial forms flickered more pronouncedly, as if his recognition had disturbed their cohesion. The Star’s voice, when she spoke again, carried a more human quality beneath its celestial resonance.\n“Help…us…” The words conveyed a struggle through layers of cosmic power.\n“How?” Lukas asked urgently. “How do I free you?”\nBut the human presence retreated, the archetypal energies reasserting themselves. The Star’s form stabilised, her constellation burning bright once more.\n“The balance must be restored,” she said, her voice once again purely cosmic. “The cards must be returned to their proper alignment. Only then can the separation between worlds be maintained.”\nDawn began to break in earnest now, the celestial visions fading with the night. The Star spoke one final time, her voice growing distant as her constellation dimmed.\n“Remember what you have seen here. The universe resides within you. As it does in all things.”\n“Even in the smallest, most seemingly insignificant acts of kindness,” The Moon added, her silver face dissolving into ordinary clouds. Her smile was enigmatic as moonlight on water as she faded from view.\n“And in every moment of courage, no matter how fleeting,” The Sun concluded, his golden visage melting into the ordinary sunrise. “The power to resist darkness lies not in grand gestures, but in the everyday choice to remain true to oneself.”\nAs the celestial Arcana disappeared, their words continued to echo in Lukas’s mind. The revelation settled into him, reshaping his understanding of his journey. He had been searching for a way home, for an escape from Arcanum’s dangers, but perhaps that had never been the true purpose of his crossing between worlds. Perhaps he had needed to see reality through Arcanum’s distorted lens to recognise the magic that had always existed in his ordinary life—the beauty of morning light on brick, the miracle of human connection, the small kindnesses that went unnoticed.\nAnd perhaps Arcanum needed him—his perspective, his choices, his peculiar blend of pragmatism and wonder—to push back against the corruption Peter spread.\nLukas took a deep breath, feeling a new kind of strength flow through him. It wasn’t the raw power that Peter had offered, but something more fundamental—clarity. Purpose. Understanding.\nThe ordinary dawn light caught on Tonto’s shell, highlighting configurations that conveyed more than just the tortoise’s life. In those age-old grooves, Lukas saw reflections of his own journey, of all journeys—moments of joy and sorrow, triumph and defeat, all woven together into something beautiful precisely because of its imperfection.\n“Thank you, old friend,” he said softly, kneeling to stroke Tonto’s weathered shell. “For staying with me. For showing me the way.”\nThe tortoise blinked slowly, his wisdom-filled eyes reflecting a knowledge that transcended worlds. His steady presence had been the one constant in a realm of perpetual change, a tether to truth when illusions threatened to overwhelm.\nAs Lukas straightened, he noticed a difference in the air around him—a subtle shift in the energy of Arcanum itself. Before, the realm had felt hostile, its twisted reality a trap designed to ensnare him. Now it felt… responsive. Not friendly, exactly, but more akin to a musical instrument awaiting a skilled hand. The city’s unfathomable architecture no longer conveyed mockery but instead waited, attentive, for his next move.\nFrom the early morning mist on the bridge, shapes began to emerge—familiar figures moving with purpose through the thinning fog. They approached cautiously at first, then with growing confidence as they recognised him.\nThe High Priestess emerged first, her white robes flowing akin to liquid moonlight. She had been Maya, the librarian from near his house. Now, her eyes held the unsettling wisdom of centuries, though occasionally they would blink with Maya’s characteristic nervousness. When she gestured with her hands, there was Maya’s precise movement—the way she’d once shelved books with careful attention—translated into arcane significance. In moments of concentration, her human consciousness conveyed closer proximity to the surface, manifesting in the slight tilt of her head that Maya always used when contemplating a difficult reference question.\n“We felt the shift,” she said, her voice resonating with newfound authority. “Something has changed. You have changed.”\nThe Chariot followed, the morning light gleaming off his ethereal armour. In his ordinary life, he had been Detective Inspector Matthews. Here in Arcanum, that investigative quality had transformed into something more literal—a warrior’s resolve, a champion’s courage. Yet the same analytical squint with which he’d examined evidence now assessed the shifting landscape around them. Matthews’s methodical approach to cases now expressed itself in the precise, tactical way The Chariot positioned himself, his human habits of tapping fingers against his thumb when thinking translated into a rhythmic adjustment of his spiritual armour.\n“Peter’s influence has been pushed back,” he observed, his gaze scanning the horizon. “Not defeated, but… contained, for the moment.”\nStrength approached, her lion padding silently beside her. When she spoke, her voice carried a gentle yet firm quality.\n“You’ve found your centre,” she said, her voice gentle yet firm. “It changes everything.”\nOne by one, they gathered—The Hermit, Justice, The Emperor, Temperance—each a transformed reflection of someone Lukas had known in his ordinary life. Each now embodying an archetypal truth, yet still carrying flashes of their former personalities. They formed a circle around him on the bridge, their combined presence creating a pocket of stability in Arcanum’s shifting landscape.\n“Peter’s influence is strongest in the east,” the High Priestess announced, her gaze turning toward the rising sun. “His corrupted Arcana have taken hold there.”\n\nThe Chariot nodded, pointing toward a section of the city where the distortions were most pronounced. “The buildings are changing faster there, becoming more twisted. Reality itself is unravelling at its edges.”\nA distant roar echoed across the Thames, a sound conveying no resemblance to any earthly creature Lukas had ever heard. It sent vibrations through the bridge, causing ripples in the river below that moved against the current.\n“His forces grow bolder,” Strength observed, her hand resting on her lion’s flank. “They feel threatened by what happened here.”The Hermit stepped forward, his lantern casting a light that conveyed piercing through the very fabric of reality. “Peter is not merely angry,” he said, his voice carrying the weight of contemplation. “He is afraid. Each person you free diminishes his control, reveals the fragility of the world he’s constructed.”\nLukas looked at their faces—these transformed reflections of ordinary people now battling for Arcanum’s soul. Their expressions showed determination tinged with fear, courage undercut by doubt. They were looking to him not just for leadership but for hope.\nAnd yet, beneath their archetypal aspects, he could now perceive the trapped human essences within—frightened, confused, pulled between worlds. Their human souls were conscious captives, aware on some level of their imprisonment within these powerful but alien forms. It wasn’t just his closest friends who needed saving—it was everyone in Arcanum who had been transformed.\nDrawing on his new understanding, Lukas spoke with quiet confidence, “We’ll divide our forces. The High Priestess, take The Hermit and Justice along the Thames. The Chariot, you and Emperor circle from the north. Strength and I will take the central route with Tonto.”\nHis words carried a weight they hadn’t before, as if Arcanum itself responded to his newfound clarity. The twisted spires of Westminster conveyed straightening slightly, the unfathomable angles of the bridge stabilised beneath his feet.\n“Peter’s agents will anticipate caution,” Strength said, her lion’s eyes gleaming with tactical insight. “Sometimes the most direct path is the least expected.”\nThey moved through London’s transformed landscape with new purpose, navigating streets that folded back on themselves and buildings that breathed akin to living things. Arcanum’s reality remained fluid, but now it conveyed less hostility—more akin to an ocean with dangerous currents than an actively malevolent force.\nAs they approached Covent Garden, the distortions intensified. Market stalls floated a foot above the cobblestones, their wares shifting between mundane produce and shimmering, otherworldly orbs. The air crackled with tension, and shadows whispered as they passed.\n“There,” Strength pointed toward the Royal Opera House, its once-elegant facade now twisted into a grimacing mask. “The corruption is concentrated there.”\nThe building’s columns writhed akin to serpents, and its windows reflected geometric configurations that defied natural explanation. A darkness emanated from within—not the absence of light, but something more conscious, more deliberate. Shadows pooled at its entrance, occasionally forming shapes that suggested faces, limbs, claws.\n“They’ve sensed us,” Lukas said quietly, feeling the weight of invisible eyes upon them. Tonto pressed against his ankle, his weathered shell vibrating with a subtle warning.\nThe darkness at the Opera House entrance congealed, taking form. Figures stepped out—people Lukas recognised, though their features had been twisted by Peter’s influence. Tom, the cheerful barista who always remembered Lukas’s order, now moved with jerky, puppet-like motions, his smile stretched too wide, his eyes gleaming with malice. The darkness of Peter’s corruption clung to him comparable to a second skin, seeping from his pores and trailing behind him resembling smoke. What had once been Tom’s graceful barista movements—the elegant pour of coffee, the artistic swirl of cream—were now contorted into unnatural gestures that mimicked his former self but lacked all genuine warmth.\nBehind him came others—the florist from the corner, the teacher from the community centre, the elderly man who walked his dog in the park every morning—all transformed into corrupted versions of themselves, darkness seeping from their pores resembling smoke. Each one moved with that same unnatural rhythm, their personalities suppressed beneath Peter’s influence, yet occasionally their true selves would surface—a familiar gesture, a characteristic expression quickly consumed by the corruption that possessed them.\n“Look what wandered into our web,” Tom said, his voice grating comparable to broken glass, though undertones of his human voice occasionally broke through resembling someone drowning calling for help. “Peter told us you might come this way.” His hands, once skilled at creating intricate latte art, now dripped with a substance that resembled oil but moved with deliberate purpose. “He wants to speak with you, Lukas. He has an offer you really shouldn’t refuse.”\nThe corrupted Arcana spread out, forming a semicircle that blocked their path. Each moved with unnatural grace, as if their bodies were merely vessels for something else, something that didn’t quite understand how human limbs should work.\n“Your master has nothing I want,” Lukas replied, his voice steady despite the dread pooling in his stomach. “And you don’t belong to him either, Tom. None of you do.”\nTom’s face twisted in rage, the expression too extreme for his features. But beneath that rage, Lukas caught a flicker of something else—fear, confusion, a desperate cry for help. For a moment, Tom’s true eyes peered through the mask of corruption, silently pleading. The darkness receded momentarily from his face, showing the trapped consciousness within that remained aware of his imprisonment, helplessly watching as his body acted against his will.\n“Such arrogance!” Tom spat, though the words conveyed recitation, as if forced. “Peter offers power without limits, freedom from the mundane world’s constraints. Why do you resist? What does your… humanity… offer that compares?”\nThe question hung in the air, a challenge that demanded an answer. Lukas thought of the celestial Arcana’s revelations, of the potential futures he’d glimpsed in the Thames, of Tonto’s unwavering presence beside him. He thought of his ordinary life back in London—morning coffee on his steps, music filling his house, the simple joy of watching the city wake up.\n“It offers connection,” he said finally, the words coming from a place of certainty he hadn’t known he possessed. “Real connection, not just power over others. It offers compassion. Growth. The chance to be something more than what you were yesterday.”\nHe took a step forward, and to his surprise, the corrupted Arcana shifted back slightly, as if his words carried physical force. He recognised this moment—it was akin to when he’d convinced a sceptical record executive to back an unknown band by helping him see beyond preconceptions, by reshaping perception itself.\n“Look at yourselves,” he continued, seeing uncertainty flicker across their distorted faces. “Is this what you wanted? To be puppets? To have your essence corrupted for someone else’s agenda?”\nTom’s sneer faltered, a flicker of his true self showing through Peter’s influence. The darkness around him swirled in agitation, as if fighting to maintain its hold. The corruption that had seeped into him through promises of power and significance—whispered enticements that had played on his desire for recognition beyond his barista counter—now visibly weakened as his authentic self fought for control.\n“There is always a price,” Lukas pressed, drawing strength from Tonto’s presence beside him. Every lesson he had learned, every betrayal he had endured, every moment of fear and wonder, coalesced into this single, defiant moment. “Peter didn’t tell you that, did he? Everything he offers comes with chains attached. But you can choose differently. You can remember who you really are.”\nStrength stepped forward, her lion letting out a roar that shook the very foundations of the distorted reality around them. The sound was pure, untainted truth, a primal force that resonated with a power Peter’s corruptions couldn’t match.\nThree of the corrupted Arcana cried out, falling to their knees as the darkness receded from their forms comparable to a tide pulled back by an unseen moon. Their faces cleared, awareness returning to their eyes as they remembered who they had been before the corruption.\nThe teacher gasped, looking at her trembling hands as the oily darkness that had seeped through her skin dissipated akin to morning mist. The elderly dog walker blinked rapidly, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks as his consciousness fully returned to him, the memory of his willing submission to Peter’s temptation bringing shame and relief in equal measure.\n“The Devil’s hold can be broken!” Lukas called out, his voice filled with desperate hope. “You don’t have to be what the cards have made you! You can choose!”\nTonto moved amongst them, his slow, deliberate progress a counterpoint to the chaotic energy of the confrontation. Each touch of his shell, each seemingly insignificant nudge, conveyed anchoring them, pulling them back from the precipice of oblivion. The tortoise’s wise gaze identified those most receptive to freedom, those whose inner light still flickered beneath the corruption.\nThe corrupted florist—Emma—looked down at her hands. The darkness that had dripped from them was receding, revealing her normal skin beneath. The corruption that had taken root when she’d accepted Peter’s offer—his promise that she could create flowers that would never die, that would bring unfathomable beauty to the world—now faded as she remembered the simple joy of nurturing living things, of accepting their natural cycle of growth and decay.\n“What… what happened to me?” she whispered, horror and wonder mixing in her voice. “I remember agreeing to something… he said I could create perfect beauty that would last forever…”\n“You were used,” Strength explained gently, helping the woman to her feet. “But that doesn’t define you. Your choices from this moment forward—those define you.”\nTom’s scream of frustration cut through the air, the sound inhuman in its rage. The darkness around him intensified, forming into tendrils that lashed out resembling whips. His corruption ran deeper than the others’, Peter having exploited his deep-seated desire for recognition, his bitterness at being overlooked despite his talents.\n“This… this is not over!” he snarled, his voice cracking with desperation as his control over the others waned. “Peter sees everything! He knows your deepest fears, your secret shames! He will use them against you!”\nFor a moment—just a flicker—Tom’s expression changed. Something vulnerable, almost childlike, surfaced in his eyes. “He understands what it’s like to be trapped between worlds,” Tom whispered, his voice suddenly his own again. “He’s been searching for so long…”\nThen the darkness surged back, consuming him from within. With that, he dissolved into a swirling mass of shadows that slithered away between the distorted cobblestones, disappearing into the labyrinthine depths of Arcanum.\nThe remaining corrupted Arcana, those who hadn’t been freed, followed in his wake, leaving behind an echo of their tormented screams.\nThe liberated ones huddled together, shaken by their ordeal. The teacher stared at her trembling hands. “I remember… serving him. Willingly. I thought he was offering enlightenment, but it was just another kind of prison.”\nLukas nodded, understanding all too well Peter’s manipulative methods. “He twists your deepest desires into traps. Makes freedom look like a cage and captivity feel like liberation.”\n“There will be others,” the elderly dog walker said, his eyes clearer now but haunted by what he’d experienced. “Many others who accepted his offer, who still believe his lies.”\n“And we’ll help them too,” Lukas promised, looking around at the small victory they’d achieved. “One by one if necessary.”\nFrom other parts of the city, reports began to filter in—carried by birds with too-intelligent eyes, by shadows that moved against the light, by the wind itself which conveyed whispering messages directly into their minds. The other teams had engaged Peter’s forces and achieved similar, limited successes.\nThe corrupted Opera House had begun to straighten, its columns no longer writhing in pain, though darkness still leaked from its windows resembling smoke. The very fabric of Arcanum itself was responding to these small victories. Streets that had once twisted into painful geometric impossibilities now occasionally resolved into recognisable thoroughfares. The sky, though still alien in its colouration, showed patches of familiar blue between the swirling arrangements.\nEach freed soul conveyed anchoring reality, pulling it back toward normality one fragment at a time.\n“We have won this battle,” Lukas acknowledged, his voice weary but tinged with newfound determination. “But the war… the war for the soul of Arcanum, and perhaps for something far greater… is far from over. Peter will return. He will wear new faces, offer new temptations.”\nJustice stepped forward, her scales gleaming in the half-light. “His world is built on deception. Even the smallest truth weakens his foundations.”\n\nTonto nudged Lukas’s ankle, a gentle, persistent pressure. Lukas looked down at his faithful companion and smiled, a genuine smile that reached his eyes. “Yes, old friend,” he said softly. “We’ll be ready. We have to be.”\nAbove them, Big Ben, its hands still moving backward, chimed an unfathomable hour. The sound echoed through the distorted streets, marking time in a realm where reality itself was a constantly shifting, negotiable construct.\nAs if to confirm this unspoken thought, a single, elongated shadow, detached from any visible source, stretched across the cobblestones, lingering for a moment too long before fading away—a chilling reminder that the fight was far from over.\nThe freed Arcana gathered around them, their forms solidifying as they remembered who they truly were. In their eyes, Lukas saw both gratitude and determination. They had tasted Peter’s power and rejected it, choosing instead the harder path of remaining true to themselves. It was a small victory, perhaps, but a significant one.\nLukas lifted Tonto onto the nearby wall to see more clearly the gathering crowd. He stood resting his hand on Tonto’s shell, feeling its reassuring warmth. The celestial Arcana’s revelations echoed in his mind—that true power came not from changing reality, but from seeing it clearly; that the universe resided within him as it did in all things; that even the smallest acts of kindness and courage could push back against darkness.\nHe looked out at the city—still distorted, still dangerous, but now somehow more approachable. Not an enemy to be defeated, but a realm to be healed, one choice at a time. And with each such choice, each person freed, each truth remembered, another thread was woven into the fabric of resistance against the darkness that threatened both worlds.\nIn the distance, beyond the twisted spires of Arcanum’s skyline, the silhouette of the Tower loomed—tall, imposing, and conveying impervious to the changes rippling through the rest of the city. Something awaited him there, Lukas knew. A confrontation that would define not just his fate, but the fate of both worlds.\nBut for now, this small victory was enough—these freed souls, this reclaimed piece of Arcanum, this growing resistance against the darkness.",
