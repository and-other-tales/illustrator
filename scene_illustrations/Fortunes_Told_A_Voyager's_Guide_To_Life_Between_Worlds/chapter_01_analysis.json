    "title": "A City Wakes",
    "content": "The sun rose high above the city, casting long shadows upon the pavement of Kennington Park Road. Lukas sat perched on the top step of his Victorian terrace house, a chipped mug warming his hands, the steam a fragile, fleeting sculpture against the crisp morning air. It was his first official day of freedom – the first day in almost a decade he hadn’t been swept along in the relentless human tide towards the City. The morning air held London’s distinctive perfume: damp stone, diesel fumes and something a little sweeter – perhaps lime blossom from the trees lining the street. A siren wailed in the distance, its cry melding with the hollow rumble of the Underground beneath his feet and the persistent chatter of sparrows in the eaves above. Lukas closed his eyes briefly, letting the sounds wash over him. The city had its own soundtrack – layered, complex and almost entirely unappreciated by most. Back at the record label, he’d once created a marketing campaign for a breakout pop single about urban loneliness. He’d spent hours crafting social media content that captured the artist’s vulnerability against the backdrop of city life, finding ways to make her late-night wanderings through London streets feel both intimate and authentic. His director had called it “brilliantly atmospheric” right before laying off half the marketing team.\n“Late, absolutely late,” muttered a woman in a crisp navy suit as she hurried past, her heels striking a quick rhythm against the pavement. Her phone was pressed to her ear, her free hand clutching a takeaway coffee cup that sloshed precariously with each step. Until a few weeks ago, that had been him – racing against the tyranny of time, breakfast reduced to whatever could be consumed while speed-walking to the Tube station, headphones pumping a now-forgotten hit from what seemed equivalent to another world to keep his pace up.\nA businessman in an impeccably tailored suit strode past, barking into his mobile: “Need those projections by nine, absolutely non-negotiable.” His elbows were as sharp as his consonants, parting the morning crowd akin to a ship’s prow through waves. Lukas remembered that tone, that urgent self-importance. He’d worn it equivalent to armour, believing it made him invincible. Until the day the label was absorbed by some ultra-conglomerate and terms such as “restructuring” and “synergistic streamlining” had turned music’s last creative haven into another corporate battlefield.\n“Beautiful morning, isn’t it?” The words came from an elderly gentleman who had paused beside Lukas’s steps. His silver hair caught the sunlight, as he hummed something reminiscent of Dusty Springfield between words. “First day of freedom, by any chance?”\nLukas blinked in surprise. “How did you know?”\nThe man’s eyes crinkled with knowing amusement. “That look of peaceful defiance. Saw it in my own mirror the day I retired. Though I suspect you’re a bit young for that particular milestone.”\n“Redundancy,” Lukas explained, raising his mug in a small salute. “Or as my exit interview delicately phrased it, ‘differences in direction due to the corporate restructuring.’ Time to finally write my own stories instead of crafting ones for others.”\n“Ah, wisdom comes at different ages to different souls,” the man said, resuming his unhurried pace.\nAs the old man walked away, Lukas noticed something peculiar. The gentleman’s shadow didn’t move quite in sync with his body, trailing a half-second behind as if reluctant to follow. When it finally caught up at the corner, it rippled against the pavement, comparable to water disturbed by a thrown stone. Lukas blinked hard. When he looked again, the shadow behaved normally, though the air where the man had stood felt oddly charged.\nThe melody the man had been humming lingered in the air. The notes hovered at the threshold of hearing, occasionally shifting when he wasn’t paying direct attention, moving from major to minor and back again. The music stirred something in him – a Sunday morning from last autumn. James at the stove, Fleetwood Mac filling their tiny Hackney flat, moving through the kitchen with unexpected grace for someone so methodical in everything else. He’d made those ridiculously precise pancakes, each one perfectly measured, while Lukas had lounged at the counter arguing that imperfection was the soul of art. They’d ended up trading tastes from the same fork, the pancakes growing cold as they’d kissed, tension dissolving into laughter.\nTwo students rushed past, their conversation a rapid-fire exchange in another language that reminded Lukas of his year abroad in Stockholm. Those twelve months at the indie label had shaped his approach to music marketing more than his entire marketing degree. He’d returned to London with campaign concepts that his manager had found “uncommercially innovative” – a somewhat backhanded compliment that had both stung and filled him with pride. The pair reminded him of his university days—running between venues with promotional flyers for campus bands, convincing reluctant bar owners to host experimental music nights, his fingers perpetually stained with cheap ink from the well-worn library printer. How many times had he felt that same vibration in his fingertips after watching James drum, the residual energy of music still resonating between them?\nA young woman in a pencil skirt hurried by and Lukas noticed her mismatched socks – one navy, one a subtle shade of charcoal. It was the sort of detail he’d have completely missed when he was part of that same relentless stream, his mind already in the office before his body had arrived. As she passed, she gave him an odd, sidelong glance, as though his presence on his own doorstep was somehow unexpected.\nThe morning light caught the Victorian ironwork of his home. Having just moved in yesterday, he was struck by how the morning light transformed the ironwork into shadow-stories across the aged stone steps. Each curl and flourish resembled a character in some forgotten alphabet, spelling out stories of craftsmanship from a time when beauty was considered as essential as function. His gaze traced the ornate details, finding echoes of the elaborate band posters he’d once designed, where every visual element conveyed something about the music itself.\nAs he watched, the shadows cast by the ironwork appeared to shift independently of the light source. He had the disconcerting feeling that the house was observing him, studying him with patient curiosity. When he lifted his hand, the sensation stopped immediately, but the echo of that rhythm remained in his palm.\nA harried mother wrestled a pram past, its occupant conducting a thorough investigation of every crack in the pavement while a toddler danced an impatient circuit around them, singing an improvised song about dinosaurs. The woman’s phone was wedged between her shoulder and ear: “Yes, I know the meeting’s at nine, I’m just— No, the nursery doesn’t open until— Yes, I understand it’s important, but—”\nAs the family passed, the toddler turned and stared directly at Lukas with wide, solemn eyes for an unsettling moment before resuming his dinosaur song as if nothing had happened. The mother gave Lukas a distracted smile and hurried on, continuing her phone conversation as they disappeared around the corner.\nLukas watched them disappear, remembering countless similar scenes from his morning commutes. How many human stories had he rushed past without seeing? How many moments of frustration and joy and ordinary magic had he missed while his mind was buried in marketing materials and promotional schedules and desperate attempts to keep the artistic integrity alive in a world increasingly driven by algorithms and market research?\nA woman in a vibrant scarlet coat hurried past, her face illuminated by the glow of her earphones. “I know, I know!” she muttered, the words triggering a phantom anxiety in Lukas’s chest – that familiar flutter of panic, the obsessive checking of watches, the stomach-churning fear of being even a minute behind schedule. As she passed, she suddenly paused and glanced back at him, brow furrowed in momentary confusion. After a brief, puzzled look, she shook her head slightly as if dismissing a thought and hurried away, disappearing into the steady stream of morning commuters.\nBut he wasn’t part of that dance any more. He could sit here, watching the sun climb higher, feeling the stone steps warm beneath him, listening to the city’s symphony of sounds. His coffee had cooled to the perfect drinking temperature, and he savoured each sip, letting the bitter warmth ground him in this moment. The liquid in his mug rippled though he hadn’t moved. When he tilted the mug, the coffee hesitated before settling, as though the laws of physics had momentarily paused in deliberation. The taste had changed too, taking on subtle notes of cardamom and something older, more complex – as if time itself had steeped in his cup.\nA lone pigeon strutted past, its iridescent feathers catching the light as it investigated a discarded wrapper. Behind it came an elderly gentleman walking with deliberate slowness, his tiny Scottish terrier sniffing inquisitively at Lukas’s steps. Lukas leaned forward, offering his hand to the small creature. He’d always had a way with animals – a patience that James teased was inversely proportional to his attention span with people. The terrier sniffed his fingers tentatively before allowing a brief scratch behind the ears. Its owner nodded a curt good morning, his eyes meeting Lukas’s with quiet understanding – they were both outside the current now, observers rather than participants in the great urban rush.\nAs man and dog continued their walk, Lukas could have sworn that the terrier’s paw prints left small indentations that glowed with a soft amber light. He blinked and the pavement returned to normal, though a faint impression of something otherworldly lingered at the edges of his vision.\nThe stream of commuters began to thin as the morning aged. Lukas stretched his legs, feeling the rough texture of the stone through his jeans. A profound sense of peace settled over him, deep and uncomplicated. This was right. This was where he needed to be.\nThe late morning sun poured through the tall, sash windows of the living room, illuminating swirling dust motes and the chaotic landscape of half-unpacked boxes. Lukas paused from arranging books on the newly assembled shelves to watch James meticulously adjust his tie in the hallway mirror.\n“You sure you don’t need help?” James asked, his voice carrying that familiar note of concern masked as casual inquiry. “I could easily move my client meeting. The restoration plans for the Bloomsbury building could wait another day.” He smoothed his tie for the third time – a nervous habit from his student days when he’d sit in Lukas’s university flat, fingers fidgeting with drumsticks while Lukas played old Beatles records into the early hours and planned marketing campaigns for campus bands.\nIn those days, James had been just another architecture student with a secret passion for classicism in a department that worshipped modernism—and a surprisingly skilled drummer in one of the bands Lukas had been promoting. Lukas had found him in the university courtyard, sketching gargoyles while everyone else designed minimalist cubes. He’d been fascinated by someone who could appreciate both history and possibility – the same qualities Lukas sought in the artists whose stories he told through his marketing work.\n“And miss your moment with the heritage committee? Absolutely not.” Lukas crossed to straighten James’s already perfectly straight collar, an excuse to breathe in his familiar scent of coffee and expensive aftershave. “Besides, I want to get to know this old house properly. Explore its… peculiarities.”\nJames’s eyebrow arched slightly at the word “peculiarities,” a subtle tell that Lukas had long ago learned to recognise. It was the same look he’d given Lukas when he’d suggested they buy a flat in up-and-coming Hackney five years ago, before the area had become fashionable, or when Lukas had proposed they holiday in Kyoto during the rainy season because “the rain on temple roofs creates stories no travel brochure could capture.” A mix of scepticism and indulgent affection that said, “I think you’re slightly mad, but I’m intrigued anyway.”\nAs James arched his eyebrow, the mirror’s reflection briefly wavered, evocative of heat rising from summer asphalt. Just for a moment – so briefly he might have imagined it – Lukas caught a glimpse of something else reflected – not their hallway, but what appeared to be a grand ballroom with unfathomably high ceilings and crystal chandeliers. The vision lasted barely a second before disappearing, leaving a faint scent of beeswax and aged wood.\n“Speaking of peculiarities,” James said, picking up his leather portfolio case with a practised motion that spoke of a thousand similar mornings. His fingers traced the embossed initials – J.M. – a gift from Lukas on their fifth anniversary. “Are you absolutely certain about this, Lukas? Leaving everything behind?” His brow furrowed with genuine concern. “The market’s volatile, and your position at the label was secure…”\n“James.” Lukas pressed a gentle finger to his lips, a gesture that had become their shorthand for ‘please stop worrying.’ “We’ve been over this. The redundancy package was generous, I’ve saved carefully and…” He paused, struggling to articulate the gnawing emptiness that had been growing inside him with each corporate directive, each artistic compromise. “I need this. Need to remember who I am when I’m not defined as just another line on a spreadsheet to strike off. I need to find my own voice again”.\n“Just promise me you won’t try setting up a recording studio in the basement without consulting me first. Remember what happened in the Hackney flat.” James retorted.\nAs James mentioned the basement, Lukas felt a strange vibration beneath his feet, as though the house had shivered in response to the word. The sensation travelled up his spine, creating a pleasant tingling that lingered at the base of his skull for several seconds.\n“That was entirely the neighbour’s cat’s fault, and I maintain my innocence to this day.” When they’d tried to convert their spare bedroom into a practice space, their efforts at soundproofing had somehow created an acoustic anomaly that amplified rather than dampened sound. The neighbour’s cat had wandered in while Lukas was practising piano, and its panicked escape had resulted in a noise complaint, a broken window, and an emergency visit to the vet. James had spent weeks smoothing over relations with the neighbours while Lukas had redesigned the entire setup.\n“And yet somehow we still have that cat hair-covered microphone foam,” James said with a wry smile, the kind that crinkled the corners of his eyes and softened his otherwise precise features. “Lurking in some box, waiting to traumatise our new neighbours’ pets.”\nAs if responding to his words, a box in the corner shifted slightly, though nothing was touching it. The cardboard bulged outward for a moment before settling back into shape. From inside came a sound resembling distant purring that faded after a few seconds.\nA sharp knock interrupted them. Lukas opened the door to find Mrs. Patterson from next door, her silver hair arranged in an elegant coil, holding aloft a Victoria sponge cake on a delicate china plate.\n“Welcome to the street, dears,” she said, her voice warm and slightly musical. “Thought you might need sustenance. Moving is desperately thirsty work.”\n“Mrs. Patterson, you shouldn’t have,” Lukas said, accepting the cake gratefully. The scent of vanilla and sugar filled the air. “Please, come in. Though I should warn you, it’s rather chaotic at the moment.”\nAs the cake passed over the threshold, its aroma intensified, becoming almost intoxicating. Small golden motes appeared to rise from its surface, though when Lukas blinked, they appeared to be just ordinary steam.\n“Oh, I remember moving day vividly,” she said, navigating around a precarious tower of boxes marked\n‘VINYL - CHRONOLOGICAL - FRAGILE’\nwith surprising grace. Her eyes held a sparkle of mischief as she surveyed the room. “When my Harold and I moved in next door in ‘73, this whole row was practically condemned. Victorian architecture wasn’t exactly fashionable then. But we fought for these houses. They’re special, you know. They have… character.”\nAs Mrs. Patterson spoke the word “character,” Lukas felt the house respond. The floorboards creaked, the walls seemed to inhale subtly, and the temperature around Mrs. Patterson fluctuated—warming, then cooling, then warming again. He glanced at James, who continued the conversation without any sign of noticing these strange phenomena.\nThe chandelier above them chimed three gentle notes, though no breeze stirred its crystals. James checked his watch, a subtle movement that nonetheless spoke volumes.\n“I really must dash. Lovely to see you, Mrs. Patterson.” He kissed Lukas quickly, his lips lingering a half-second longer than necessary. “Don’t overdo it, love. And please try to get the bedroom somewhat habitable? A functioning bed is rather essential.”\nAs he turned to leave, Lukas caught a fleeting glimpse of something in James’s expression – a shadow of anxiety perhaps or something deeper – something that reminded him of the night three years ago when they’d argued about Lukas’s dream of starting his own music marketing consultancy. James had sketched an elaborate plan on napkins – timelines, budgets, risk assessments – his natural tendency to structure colliding with Lukas’s impulse to leap. The argument had ended with a smashed glass and three days of silence, only broken when Lukas had found a business plan meticulously researched and presented on his desk. “Not now,” the attached note had read, “but someday, when it’s right.” It had been both an apology and a promise – James’s way of saying he believed in Lukas’s dreams, even if his practical mind feared their timing.\nSometimes Lukas wondered if James’s need for structure wasn’t just organisation but a deeper anxiety – a need to reshape a chaotic world into something manageable, to transform unpredictability into order.\nAs the front door closed behind James, Lukas felt the house respond. The air pressure shifted slightly, the walls exhaled, and the dust motes rearranged themselves. For a fleeting second, the golden hour light streaming through the windows bent at angles that defied explanation, casting shadows that couldn’t possibly match the furniture creating them.\nAfter James’s departure, a comfortable silence settled between Lukas and Mrs. Patterson. He found mismatched mugs for tea and they sat in the only two chairs he’d managed to unpack, creating a small island of domesticity in the surrounding chaos.\n“Your young man seems… remarkably ordered,” Mrs. Patterson observed, accepting her mug with a knowing smile.\nLukas laughed softly. “That’s putting it mildly. James thrives on structure – spreadsheets, schedules, five-year plans. I’ve seen him rearrange an entire bookshelf because one volume was half an inch out of alignment. I’m a bit more… fluid.”\n“A free spirit?” Mrs. Patterson’s eyes held a glint of something deeper than simple understanding. “This house will suit you, then. It has a way of… accommodating its owners. Revealing things, gradually.” She gestured toward the built-in shelves where Lukas had been arranging his eclectic collection of music books, vintage album covers, and dog-eared notebooks filled with lyrics and promotional ideas.\nAs she pointed, Lukas could have sworn the books on the shelf rippled as water disturbed by a pebble. When he looked again, three volumes had changed position, though he distinctly remembered placing them differently.\n“My Harold was a bit like your James – everything in its proper place” she said, wistfully. “He was convinced he’d organised his books alphabetically, yet somehow his favourites always seemed to migrate to the most accessible shelves. Claimed it was the house… being thoughtful.” she remarked as her eyes tracked something over Lukas’s shoulder with quiet interest.\n“Houses do settle,” Lukas said, attempting rationality despite a flutter of something like anticipation in his chest. “Creaks and groans, the natural movement of old foundations.”\n“Oh, it’s more than that,” Mrs. Patterson leaned forward in her chair, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “These old houses… they absorb something of their inhabitants over the years. Similar to a recording, if you’ll pardon the metaphor.” She smiled, acknowledging his profession. “Harold always said he could hear music sometimes – as distant records playing, though we never owned a player.”\nThe air around them thickened as she spoke, taking on a honey-like quality that bent the light. From somewhere deep within the house came a sound – three notes that might have been the opening of “Space Oddity,” followed by seconds of perfect silence. When the silence ended, the air returned to normal, though the temperature had dropped noticeably.\nA sound chimed somewhere deep within the house – a melodious, slightly off-key note that made Lukas frown. He hadn’t unpacked any clocks yet.\n“Oh my,” Mrs. Patterson straightened suddenly. “Look at the time! I really must be going. But you absolutely must come round for tea soon. I have albums… photographs of the street from the seventies. Such transformations you wouldn’t believe.”\nAs she moved toward the door, Lukas had the peculiar sensation that her shadow separated briefly from her feet, lagging several steps behind before rejoining her at the threshold.\nAfter she left, Lukas stood in the centre of the room, surrounded by the comfortable clutter of his half-unpacked life. The house felt both familiar and strangely alive, as a presence quietly observing him. He’d chosen it partly for the original Victorian features that James had rhapsodised about – the ornate crown mouldings, the authentic fireplaces – but also for the way sound moved through its spaces, creating natural reverberations that reminded him of concert halls with ideal acoustics.\nHe turned back to the bookshelves, determined to impose some order on at least this small corner of his new world. But he paused, eyes narrowing in concentration. Hadn’t he just arranged that shelf? The books seemed… different. Slightly rearranged, as if someone had shifted their positions while he wasn’t looking directly at them. He definitely remembered placing his dog-eared copy of that John Niven novel next to his well-worn edition of “Vinyl Revival: The Analogue Renaissance.” Now they were separated by a slender volume he didn’t even recognise.\nThe spine was faded, the title just barely legible: “Whispers Between Worlds.” When he touched the unknown book, his fingers tingled strangely. The cover felt simultaneously ancient and unfathomably smooth, akin to stone that had been polished for millennia. Lukas reached for it, but a distant sound—the subtle creak of a floorboard—distracted him. He turned his head, listening intently. The house settled around him, the afternoon light shifting in ways that seemed both natural and slightly deliberate, creating new shadows across the floor. For an instant, he thought he caught movement at the edge of his vision—not something physical, but more akin to a shift in the quality of the air itself. Lukas turned back to the bookshelf, his eyes finding the spine again. But now the faded lettering read something different entirely: Wind in the Willows. “Strange”, he thought, blinking hard and looking again. “I could have sworn”…\n“Right,” he muttered, his voice a little louder than strictly necessary in the growing quiet. “Let’s see what secrets you’re hiding, shall we?” The afternoon light shifted subtly, casting new shadows across the floor. As Lukas moved through the rooms, unpacking boxes with methodical determination, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was observing him, assessing him. Each object he placed felt comparable to an offering, a small token of domesticity laid before some ancient, watchful presence.\nAs he unpacked his collection of vintage vinyl, he noticed that when he turned away, the records appeared to reorganise themselves. Each time he looked back at the shelf, albums had changed position, grouping themselves differently than how he’d arranged them. After the third rearrangement, he gave up and allowed the house’s logic to prevail.\nThe late afternoon sun painted the living room in shades of amber and gold, casting long fingers of light through the tall windows. Dust motes danced in the beams resembling tiny constellations, moving in configurations that appeared almost… deliberate. The air held the lingering scent of old paper, lemon drizzle cake, and something else – something floral and elusive that he couldn’t quite identify.\nHe held his copy of Great Expectations, its cover soft and yielding beneath his fingers from years of countless late night reads. As he moved to return it to its proper place, something caught his eye – a discrepancy in the shadows cast by the bookcase. For a brief moment, it stretched across the floor at an angle that defied natural explanation, far too long and distorted for the position of the sun. Lukas blinked hard, shaking his head. When he looked again, the shadow seemed normal, obedient to the ordinary laws of physics. But the unsettling feeling remained, evocative of a faint, discordant note in an otherwise familiar melody.\nHe moved to the window, seeking the grounding familiarity of the outside world. The street below appeared perfectly normal: buses trundled past, pedestrians walked their dogs, a ginger cat luxuriated in a patch of sunlight on a neighbouring windowsill. But when he turned back to face the room, the bookshelves appeared to loom slightly larger than before, their upper reaches disappearing into shadows that shouldn’t exist in such a well-lit space.\nLooking back outside, he had the unsettling impression that people were watching him. A woman pushed her child’s pushchair with one hand while pointing up at his window with the other, leaning to whisper something to her companion. A man walking his dog stopped directly across the street, staring openly at Lukas’s window before shaking his head and continuing on his way.\nClosing his eyes, Lukas counted to ten – a childhood habit from when his father had taught him to count measures on the piano. When he opened them, the room had returned to its proper proportions. The shelves were their usual height, the shadows behaved as they should. It was as if the house had taken a deep breath and exhaled, returning to a state of perfect normality.\nBut the moment of strangeness lingered in his mind, comparable to the after-image of a camera flash or the phantom note that seems to hang in the air after a piano key is struck.\n“Tea,” he announced to the empty room, his voice deliberately steady. “Definitely time for another cup of tea.”\nIn the kitchen, he filled the kettle, hand hovering over his favourite mug – the chipped blue one with the faded Regal Recordings logo, now defunct but forever immortalised in his collection of band shirts and memorabilia.\nAs he waited for the water to boil, his gaze was drawn to the kitchen tiles. For a fleeting moment, he could have sworn the arrangements were shifting, black and white squares rearranging themselves in his peripheral vision. When he focused directly on them, the tiles remained fixed, but when he deliberately looked away while maintaining peripheral awareness, they appeared to move.\nHe felt a wave of dizziness wash over him, as though the room were subtly rotating. The kettle clicked off with an abrupt mechanical sound that made him jump. Steam billowed upward, forming shapes that appeared almost… intentional, evocative of words forming and dissolving before he could read them. The steam dissipated after several seconds, leaving behind a scent that shifted between Earl Grey, jasmine, and something older and unidentifiable.\nNight was falling now, the sky outside deepening to indigo. The house creaked and settled around him, but each sound conveyed more meaning than it should, as if the very walls were trying to speak. From upstairs came a soft thud, then another – resembling footsteps, except he was absolutely alone in the house. Wasn’t he?\nThe telephone rang, making him start. James’s name lit up the screen, a welcome anchor to normality.\n“Just checking you haven’t buried yourself under an avalanche of vinyl,” James said, his voice warm with affectionate concern beneath the office background noise.\n“Still excavating,” Lukas replied, trying to keep his voice light despite the way the shadows in the corner of the room appeared to be deepening, moving with subtle purpose. “The house is… interesting.”\n“Interesting?” James’s tone sharpened slightly. “What do you mean?”\nAs Lukas searched for words, the kitchen light flickered – not randomly, but in a distinct arrangement. The shadows in the corner formed what resembled a doorway for a few seconds before dissolving back into ordinary darkness. The temperature dropped noticeably, then returned to normal.\n“Just… old house things. Creaks and groans. You know.”\nBut did James know? Could he explain the way the rooms appeared to shift when he wasn’t looking directly at them? The strange, unfathomable angles of the shadows? The books that moved of their own accord?\n“Well, I’ve good news,” James said, his voice brightening. “The heritage committee loved the restoration proposal. They’ve actually asked if we’d consider extending the scope to include the adjacent building. It would mean more work, but…” He paused, and Lukas could almost see him, sitting at his drafting table, fingers trailing over the intricate plans he created, the world reimagined according to his vision. It was what had drawn Lukas to him at university – that ability to see not just what was, but what could be. To transform reality through sheer force of imagination and will. In his own way, James was as much an artist as any musician Lukas had promoted, though he’d never accept the label.\n“I’m proud of you,” Lukas said, meaning it. “You’ve worked so hard on this.”\n“Get some rest,” James said softly, the office sounds fading as he presumably moved to a quieter space. “I’ll be home tomorrow. We can tackle the rest of the unpacking together.”\nAfter hanging up, Lukas stood for a while in the room, feeling the weight of the house’s attention around him. The darkness outside pressed against the windows comparable to a living thing somewhere deep within the walls, something chimed midnight – though his phone clearly showed 10:47 PM.\nHe climbed the stairs slowly, each step feeling slightly… wrong, as if the risers were a fraction of an inch too high or too low. The staircase appeared to extend and contract with each step, as if the house were breathing around him.\nThe landing stretched before him, the wallpaper arrangement shifting at the edges of his vision. In the bedroom, he went through his nightly routine with deliberate normality – brushing teeth, washing face, changing into pyjamas. Each familiar action felt comparable to an anchor, a tether to the ordinary world.\nYet even these simple tasks felt somehow altered. The water from the tap ran in unusual spirals before behaving as it should. His reflection in the bathroom mirror appeared to move a fraction of a second after he did, as if time itself were slightly out of sync.\nHe crawled into bed, pulling the covers up tightly around him. But as he lay there in the darkening room, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the shadows in the corners were deepening, growing, reaching out with tendrils of inky blackness. The house settled around him with sighs and whispers, sounds that might have been the natural noises of an old building – or might have been something else entirely.\nAs consciousness began to slip away, Lukas couldn’t shake the feeling that when he opened his eyes again, the world he knew would be… different. In the silence of the night, as his breathing deepened and slowed, the house seemed to exhale, settling into itself. The shadows retreated to their corners, the wallpaper stilled its undefinable dance, and everything appeared perfectly normal once more.\nBut beneath the surface, in the spaces between reality and dream, something stirred. Something waited. And as the first light of dawn began to creep across the London sky, the house held its breath, poised on the cusp of revelation.",
