    "content": "The air lay still, a morning breath held captive inside Arcanum’s Kennington Park. The usual chaotic symphony of unnatural angles and shimmering distortions had fallen silent, replaced by an eerie stillness. Above, frost-limned windows caught the pearl-grey dawn, their reflections twisting into delicate fractals that conveyed stories of their own. One of the Georgian terraces leaned at an almost imperceptible angle, just enough to make the reflections in its windows stretch and warp the world within.\nLukas sat on a park bench that wavered precariously between existence and non-existence, his hand resting on the familiar, weathered shell of Tonto. Wreaths hung on doors at angles defying physics, their red berries glowing with an inner light that pulsed in time with some unheard celestial rhythm. The park was decorated comparable to Christmas in Arcanum’s own peculiar way – icicles that grew upward instead of down, tinsel that moved akin to liquid silver in the still air fairy lights that appeared to illuminate spaces that didn’t quite exist.\n“Just us now, old friend,” he murmured, his voice a fragile thread in the heavy silence. He scratched lightly at the spot behind Tonto’s head, a gesture that usually elicited a contented shift from the timeless tortoise. Today there was nothing.\nHis fingers found the small notch in Tonto’s shell—a perfect semicircle worn smooth with age. Lukas remembered the first time he’d noticed it, when they were fleeing The Magician’s illusions. He’d asked about it during a rare moment of rest. Tonto had pressed against his hand with unusual insistence, as if to say some scars were memories worth keeping. That silent answer had sustained Lukas through their darkest moments in The Tower, had reminded him that imperfection often marked the most important experiences.\n“Quite the journey, eh? Never thought I’d see the inside of a magic shop, let alone another dimension.”\nThe square, at first glance, resembled a postcard of Georgian serenity. But familiarity was a deceptive mask in Arcanum. Iron railings curled in unnatural spirals, and the branches of plane trees traced mathematical equations too perfect to be natural against the pearl-grey sky.\nTonto’s eyes, venerable wells of timeless wisdom, met Lukas’s. They held a familiar knowing, a patient understanding that had guided him through countless perils. The tortoise shifted, pressing against Lukas’s leg with unusual tenderness. A silent farewell.\n“I’ll miss this place, in a strange way,” Lukas confessed, his voice barely a whisper. “Even with all its dangers. The way the buildings dance when they think no one’s watching. The clouds that flow akin to water. The light that comes from nowhere and everywhere at once.”\nHis mind wandered to their encounter with The Hermit, how Tonto had somehow communicated with the ancient figure in a language beyond words. The tortoise had positioned himself precisely between Lukas and danger, his shell catching moonlight in configurations that had momentarily confused Peter’s servants. Not for the first time, Lukas wondered how many travellers Tonto had guided before him, how many souls had relied on those knowing eyes to navigate Arcanum’s treacherous beauty.\nA single leaf, brittle and brown, skittered across the square, tracing a perfect Fibonacci spiral on the cobblestones. A design born of something far beyond the reach of any earthly soft breeze.\nThe silence deepened, heavy with unspoken goodbyes, with the weight of the journey’s inevitable end. Tonto emitted a soft sound, a low rumble deep within his ageless frame, a sound that could have been a sigh or a contented hum. It drew Lukas’s attention back to the tortoise. The usual golden glow that emanated from the intricate designs on his shell appeared dimmer now, flickering equivalent to candlelight in a dying breeze.\n“You’ve been the best guide I could have asked for,” Lukas said, his voice catching. He noticed the vibrant energy that usually pulsed beneath Tonto’s shell appeared muted, comparable to stars fading at dawn. “I don’t think I would have survived Peter’s tricks without you.”\nHe remembered their first escape from Peter, when Tonto had led him through what appeared to be a solid wall, somehow knowing exactly where reality thinned enough to pass through. Lukas had panicked, certain they were about to crash into unyielding stone, but Tonto had pressed firmly against his ankle, a silent command to trust.\nThe tortoise stilled. His head drooped slightly, his usually bright eyes clouding over with a film that wasn’t quite sorrow but something deeper—acceptance, perhaps. The small claws of a partially extended leg lost their grip, falling limp against Lukas’s trousers.\nAbove them, the church bells of Arcanum began to toll – not the familiar peals of London churches, but something deeper, more resonant, as if the very fabric of reality was chiming its own transformation.\nAlarm shot through Lukas. He slid from the bench, kneeling beside his friend, his hand trembling as he reached out. “Tonto? What’s wrong?”\nThe timeless creature’s eyes met his once more, filled with a profound mixture of joy and a heart-wrenching certainty. Tonto’s breathing became shallow, each inhale a gentle effort against the weight of centuries.\n“No,” Lukas whispered, gathering the tortoise gently into his arms. “Please, no. Not now. Not when we’re so close to home.”\nHe cradled Tonto against his chest, feeling the venerable shell beneath his fingers. It felt different somehow, lighter. As if the very essence that animated the creature, the magic that had allowed him to navigate the treacherous currents of Arcanum, was slowly dissolving—not into nothingness, but into something else, something that might continue in another form.\nLukas remembered that first meeting – Tonto on that little red stool outside Cassandra’s shop, those knowing eyes fixing him with a gaze that somehow reminded him of his first music teacher, the one who’d taught him to hear the spaces between notes as carefully as the notes themselves. Tonto had guided him with that same silent wisdom, communicating volumes through the smallest shifts in posture, teaching Lukas to perceive arrangements and harmonies in Arcanum that would have otherwise remained invisible to him. Every nudge, every gentle pressure against his ankle had been a note in their unspoken duet, a composition written in trust and mutual understanding.\n“Please,” Lukas begged, his voice cracking. “I still need you. We haven’t finished our journey.”\nThe plea hung in the still air, unanswered. In the distance, Big Ben tolled backwards through time, each strike resonating with the weight of moments slipping away.\nTonto pressed his head against Lukas’s hand one final time, a gesture of unconditional love and friendship. His timeless eyes, filled with centuries of wisdom, softened with acceptance that it was time to part, and the configurations on his shell, which had always appeared to shift and change unlike other living things, began to pulse with newfound intensity, as if gathering themselves for something momentous.\nWith a final, soft exhalation that conveyed the echoes of countless worlds, Tonto’s physical form grew still. Yet the venerable designs beneath Lukas’s fingers didn’t simply fade—they intensified, becoming brighter, more distinct, as though preparing for something beyond mere ending.\nThe square plunged into an unfathomable silence, a stillness so profound it felt akin to the moment between heartbeats. The buildings appeared to bow inward, their unnatural angles twisting into curves of reverence. Even the ever-present shimmer of Arcanum’s magic gathered itself, condensing around them comparable to dew preparing to transform.\nLukas cradled the ancient tortoise, tears streaming down his face, each drop a tiny burst of warmth against the cooling shell. Each tear captured and held the strange light of Arcanum, refracting it into miniature rainbows that danced across the venerable designs.\n“I don’t understand,” Lukas whispered, his fingers tracing the intricate designs on Tonto’s shell. Each groove felt akin to a story, a map of all the journeys they’d shared. It contained that same ineffable quality – information encoded in a language beyond words, yet somehow perfectly comprehensible to the heart.\nAs his fingers traced one particular swirling motif, a small section - no larger than a guitar pick—came loose in his hand. The piece appeared to have detached naturally along one of the shell’s seams. Lukas stared at it in wonder, noticing how it continued to glow faintly with Arcanum’s peculiar light. Without thinking, he carefully placed it in his shirt pocket, feeling an instinctive need to keep this small token of his extraordinary friend.\nThe morning light cast long shadows across the square, but these shadows behaved properly for the first time since he’d entered this realm. No dancing at the edges, no subtle movements when no one was watching. Just ordinary shadows marking ordinary time. Even the ambient sounds had changed, the ethereal overtones of Arcanum fading into the simpler acoustics of ordinary reality, as though the cosmic symphony was diminishing into a more limited tonal range.\n“Thank you,” he whispered, his words carrying the weight of all they had shared, all the unspoken understanding that had bound them together. “Thank you for everything.”\nAs the last word left his lips, something extraordinary happened. A single snowflake appeared, materialising out of the still, grey air. It was unlike anything Lukas had ever seen in Arcanum. This realm was a place of uncanny skies and implausible geometry; snow, that purest expression of earthly winter, had never existed here.\nThis snowflake defied even the altered laws of this realm. Instead of falling, it drifted upwards from the ground, a delicate white feather ascending towards the pearl-grey sky. Then another followed, and another, until the air was filled with a silent, surreal ballet. Snowflakes rose from the cobblestones, from the bare branches of the plane trees, from the rooftops of the unimaginably angled buildings, all rising in a silent, reverent tribute.\nIt was as if the world itself was weeping in reverse, mourning the loss of this extraordinary being. Each ascending flake caught the light in ways defying natural laws, carrying fragments of memories within their crystalline structures – offering traces of all the lives Tonto had touched, all the travellers he had guided through Arcanum’s treacherous paths.\nLukas remained kneeling in the gravity-defying snow, holding his friend, the weight of grief heavy on his shoulders. He understood that some endings were also beginnings, that love, even in farewell, possessed its own unique and potent magic.\nThrough his tears, he saw the configurations on Tonto’s shell beginning to change—not fading comparable to paint washing away but transforming, rearranging themselves into new designs akin to stars forming fresh constellations.\nThe rising snow intensified, creating a vortex of white around Lukas and Tonto. The flakes danced in the air, catching the pale light and turning the square into a swirling nebula of transformation. Each snowflake conveyed a piece of Arcanum’s magic within it, transforming the ordinary act of snowfall into something profound and sacred.\nIn the distance, church bells began to toll – real bells this time, their sound pure and unmistakably of the ordinary world. The border between realms was thinning, and through his tears, Lukas could see the familiar shapes of London beginning to emerge through Arcanum’s shifting facade.\nThe upward-falling snow began to gather around them, creating ghostly columns of white that defied gravity. Each crystalline particle caught the light akin to a shard of memory, making the air shimmer with countless points of illumination. The cold beauty of it only emphasised the growing stillness in his arms.\nA single flake broke from the arrangement, drifting up from Tonto’s shell with deliberate slowness. As it passed through a shaft of morning light, it refracted the beam into a momentary spectrum. In that prismatic instant, Lukas saw everything – every step of their journey together, every silent communication, every moment of guidance and protection. He saw the strength Tonto had instilled in him, the courage he had unknowingly drawn from the timeless creature’s unwavering presence.\n“It wasn’t about getting home, was it?” he said softly. “It was never about finding my way back to London. It was about understanding that love…” He paused as the gravity-defying snow swirled around them. “Love transcends all of this. Even magic. Even death.”\nThe realisation settled over him comparable to the weight of all the ascending snow – gentle but unfathomable to ignore. Tonto had known from the beginning that this journey would end here, in this quiet square, with this final lesson. The greatest magic wasn’t in the cards or in Arcanum’s unnatural architecture – it was in the connections formed, the truths learned, the love shared.\nIn the corner of the square, a grandfather clock that hadn’t been there moments before began to chime. Its face showed time moving in all directions at once, but its sound was pure and true. Each strike conveyed the weight of Tonto’s final gift – the understanding that real magic existed in both worlds, in the simple act of loving despite knowing loss would come.\nAs the clock completed its mind-bending count, a small design on Tonto’s shell—right where Lukas’s tears had fallen—began to glow with quiet persistence. The design separated from the shell, hovering momentarily in the air as a luminous symbol before settling onto Lukas’s palm. It burned cold for a moment before fading into his skin, leaving a faint mark akin to an ancient sigil—its meaning a mystery that stirred something deep in his memory, yet remained just beyond his understanding.\nLukas rose to his feet. As he began to make his way toward the park’s edge, he turned to look back at the bench where his friend lay. Through the upward-drifting snow, now settling as a gentle shroud over Tonto’s still form, he glimpsed something that made him pause.\nA figure emerged through the mist—tall and ethereal, mounted on a white horse that moved with unearthly silence. The rider appeared to shimmer, as though clothed in armour that caught light from another realm entirely, though the details wavered reminiscent of a heat mirage. It was as though time itself had slowed, the rider advancing in almost slow-motion, each movement flowing into the next with such grace and an almost instilling beauty that deepened the already profound silence of the park. The rider’s presence commanded a reverence that hushed even the deathly quiet a million times over, creating a pocket of stillness within stillness.\nThe horse’s hooves made no sound against the snow-covered ground, its passage as quiet as falling snow itself. The deathly silence that surrounded them felt sacred, venerable, as though this moment existed outside the ordinary flow of time.\nAs the figure neared the bench, a singular star began to glow in the skies above Kennington Park. Its twinkle, though weighted with solemnity, brought at least some form of comfort that would persist and be there for his journey back home.\nLukas smiled and nodded at the star, a knowing salute to the celestial witness of this moment. With a final glance at the shimmering rider and his fallen friend, he turned from the scene, the mark on his palm pulsing gently as he made his way toward the edge of the park.\nAs he walked, winding through Arcanum’s shifting landscape, the realisation of what he must do crystallised in his mind. Peter would be waiting—had always been waiting—for this final confrontation. The mathematician who had created this mirror version of London from his desperate need to escape reality’s cruelties. Lukas understood now that defeating Peter wasn’t about battle or magic; it was about helping him see what Tonto had shown Lukas: that running from reality only created beautiful prisons.\nThe streets began to change around him, sometimes familiar, sometimes bewildering, leading him inevitably toward the place where it had all begun. Not a bridge between worlds, but a moment of choice between two ways of seeing the same world.\nDawn painted the sky in desperate shades of crimson as Lukas reached the point where Arcanum’s illusions were strongest. Here, reality wavered reminiscent of heatwaves, the buildings twisting in ways defying comprehension, the very air shimmering with mathematical equations made manifest. The Thames flowed in confounding arrangements nearby, sections moving upstream while others rushed toward the sea, creating whirlpools that shouldn’t exist.\nHis heart still ached from Tonto’s transformation, the weight of the tortoise’s final moments pressing against his chest comparable to a stone. The white cascade continued its upward dance around him, each particle catching the blood-red light of sunrise.\n“Such a transformation need not be permanent,” came a voice that appeared to emanate from the very equations that held Arcanum together. “Stay, and what you’ve lost can become something new again.”\nPeter materialised before him, his form shifting between states—one moment a being of shadow and fractured light with obsidian wings that stretched across the width of the street, the next a gaunt man with hollow eyes and ink-stained fingers. This was the first time Lukas had seen Peter’s true human form—the lonely mathematician who had discovered Arcanum’s equations and lost himself within them.\n“I know what it’s like,” Peter said, his voice suddenly stripped of its supernatural resonance, becoming the weary tones of a man who had calculated himself into isolation. “To feel connected to something, then watch it slip away.”\nHis human eyes—grey as November rain—held a desperate loneliness that made Lukas’s heart constrict with unexpected compassion.\n“Stay here, where nothing need ever truly end.”\nFor a moment, Lukas could see the human Peter had once been—a brilliant mind who had glimpsed configurations others couldn’t see, who had retreated into his equations when human connections proved too painful or complex to navigate. In that haunted gaze, Lukas recognised something of himself—the same retreat into music when reality had become too harsh, the same desire to create perfect motifs to compensate for life’s messiness.\n“I can give you wonders beyond imagining,” Peter continued, his form expanding once more into something terrible and beautiful, wings of obsidian light casting shadows that moved against the direction of the sunrise. “A world where death is merely a transition, where loss can always be reversed.”\nThe ascending snow danced between them, each particle a tiny mirror reflecting what could be. Peter’s offer was almost overwhelming, a siren’s call to his deepest desires. In the swirling white, Lukas could almost see Tonto alive again, could almost feel the warmth of his presence.\n“You never understood, did you?” His voice was quiet but steady, surprisingly resolute in the face of such immense power. “Tonto’s sacrifice wasn’t about escaping reality through magic. It was about truly seeing reality—all of it. About being fully present in every moment, whether wonderful or terrible.”\nPeter’s form flickered, the human mathematician momentarily visible again, his face contorted with pain and longing.\n“Reality is cruel,” he said, his voice breaking. “I calculated the precise mathematics of suffering. I quantified the exact equations of loss. Reality is merely the cruellest of all possible dimensions.”\n“No,” Lukas said gently, seeing Peter—truly seeing him—perhaps for the first time. “Reality is where love matters precisely because it doesn’t last forever. Where connections mean something because they can be broken.”\nPeter’s beautiful, terrible form resumed, wings beating against the dawn, but now Lukas could see the frightened mathematician hiding within the majestic illusion.\n“You would choose to see London only through mundane eyes again? Exist without magic?” Peter’s voice shifted between supernatural resonance and human desperation.\nLukas smiled through his tears, a genuine, heartfelt smile that reached his eyes. “There’s magic in London—there always has been. Arcanum isn’t somewhere else; it’s here, woven into every brick and cobblestone. Tonto showed me how to see both at once. His love wasn’t about lasting forever—it was about showing me the truth.”\nAs he spoke, the mark on his palm—Tonto’s final gift—warmed slightly, pulsing with quiet assurance. It wasn’t flashy magic, just the subtle comfort of connection that transcended worlds and even death itself. This was what Peter could never understand—that true magic wasn’t found in spectacle but in genuine bonds freely given.\n“I spent 40 years,” Peter said, his human form briefly emerging again, “calculating the perfect equation—a mathematics of reality that could undo suffering.” His voice cracked. “No one should have to endure what ordinary reality demands of us.”\nIn that moment, Lukas saw Peter not as an enemy but as a brilliant mind broken by the very problem Lukas himself had faced—how to reconcile the wonder and cruelty of existence, how to find meaning in a world where everything precious eventually ends.\n“The perfection you’re searching for,” Lukas said gently, “it doesn’t exist. Not even here.” He gestured to Arcanum’s unnatural architecture. “You’ve created a beautiful illusion, but it’s still just running away.”\nPeter lunged forward, his form spreading akin to spilled ink across the street, his power threatening to engulf Lukas. The obsidian wings beat the air, creating a chilling soft breeze that smelled of sulphur and regret.\n“Then stay here in pain! Stay where every moment reminds you of what you’ve lost!”\nBut Lukas stood his ground, feeling Tonto’s final peaceful moment in his arms, understanding at last the profound lesson the ancient tortoise had imparted. This wasn’t about escaping grief; it was about understanding its place in the tapestry of life.\n“Love doesn’t need to cross between worlds when there’s only one world to begin with—seen through different eyes,” Lukas said, his voice echoing across the street that existed in both London and Arcanum simultaneously.\nPeter’s scream shattered windows along the street, a sonic wave of frustration and defeat. But its power washed over Lukas without effect, bouncing harmlessly off the shield of his newfound understanding.\nIn that moment, he saw clearly—the being before him was nothing but fear given form, the terror of accepting life’s imperfections, the desperate clinging to a world where loss could be undone, where reality could be bent to avoid pain.\n“You have no power over me,” Lukas said softly, his voice filled with compassion rather than defiance. “You never did. The real magic was always in here.” He pressed his hand to his heart, feeling the echo of Tonto’s love resonate within him. “In accepting both the joy and the pain. In loving despite knowing we’ll lose. In seeing wonder in the ordinary.”\nHe thought of the marketing campaigns he’d created that had felt most meaningful—never the technically perfect ones, but those born from real emotion: the narrative he’d crafted during the painful months of his sister’s illness. The works where imperfection and humanity had been allowed to show through had always felt most authentic to him.\nPeter’s magnificent form began to dissolve, wings turning to mist in the morning light. For a brief moment, only the man remained—thin, pale, with ink-stained fingers and haunted eyes.\n“They called me mad,” he whispered. “Said my equations were unfathomable. But I solved them. I found the place where reality bends.”\n“And lost yourself in it,” Lukas said gently. “Found a perfect world but couldn’t bring your humanity with you.”\n“It will be lonely without you,” Peter admitted, his form growing translucent. “So few understand the designs.”\nFor the first time, his smile was genuine, human, touched with sadness rather than malice. “Perhaps there is a theorem I missed. An equation of imperfection I failed to calculate.”\n“Maybe there’s no equation for that,” Lukas replied. “Maybe that’s the whole point.”\nAs the sun broke fully over the horizon, bathing the street in golden light, Peter’s form appeared to come to a decision. His eyes fixed on Lukas with a new clarity, the desperation slowly giving way to understanding.\nHe reached into the pocket of his weathered jacket—now fully human, the obsidian wings and supernatural darkness having receded completely. From it, he withdrew a small nub of chalk, worn down by years of use. Lukas could see faint mathematical notations embedded in its texture, complex equations and formulas that had once mapped the pathways between worlds.\n“This,” Peter said, his voice now entirely human, carrying the weight of decades of isolation, “is the last thing I brought with me from the other side. The chalk I used to first calculate the equations that opened the door to Arcanum.” He turned it over in his fingers, revealing an almost invisible series of numbers and symbols etched into its side.\n“All this time, I’ve kept it. When everything else from my human life faded—memories of family, of friends, of who I was before—this remained. My link to what I once was.” His voice cracked slightly. “My final tether to the mathematician who thought he could solve the universe’s cruelty through pure logic.”\nHe extended one hand—human now, with age spots and paper cuts from years of mathematical work—and pressed the small nub into Lukas’s palm.\n“For the configurations you might still wish to understand,” he said, his voice fading as his form began to disperse comparable to morning fog. “Some questions are worth pursuing, even without perfect answers.”\nAs the chalk touched Lukas’s skin, he felt the fundamental shift occur. The air around them shimmered and twisted as Arcanum’s unnatural geometries began to unravel. Peter’s final act of selflessness—giving up the one thing that had anchored him to his mathematical paradise—had broken the equations that held this mirror world together.\n“Thank you,” Lukas said softly, understanding the enormous sacrifice this simple gesture represented.\nPeter’s form was barely visible now, just a human outline in the morning mist. “Perhaps,” he whispered, his voice already distant, “you were right. Perhaps the perfection I sought was never in the equations at all.”\nWith those words, he dissolved completely into the golden light of dawn, not vanquished but transformed, finally releasing his desperate grip on both his illusion and reality.\nThe world around Lukas shuddered, not so much changing as revealing its true nature. The twisted architecture of Arcanum didn’t disappear—it settled, revealing itself to have always been London, just seen through the lens of mathematical impossibility. Fish that had been swimming through air merged seamlessly with the Thames below, their scales still occasionally flashing with light when viewed from certain angles.\nBuildings that had writhed with Peter’s influence now stood as familiar London structures, though Lukas could still perceive subtle movements when he looked with his newfound vision. A gust of soft breeze whipped across the street, carrying the scent of diesel and coffee, yet within that ordinary breeze, Lukas could now detect configurations and whispers of what he had known as Arcanum—not gone, just integrated into his perception of London as it had always been.\nLukas noticed that where Arcanum had been most powerfully manifested, ordinary London now showed subtle differences—not magical distortions, but whispers of what he now understood lay beneath all reality. A lamp post leaned at a slightly more graceful angle, a section of pavement formed a more perfect curve, a wrought-iron gate displayed slightly more organic motifs in its design. Not Arcanum imposing itself on London, but Lukas’s perception revealing the hidden elegance that had always been there.\nThe ascending snow ceased, leaving only ordinary snowflakes drifting downward through ordinary air, a gentle reminder of the extraordinary events that had just transpired.\nLukas stood on the familiar London street as normality returned, feeling both heavier and lighter. Heavier with the weight of his grief, but lighter with the understanding he had gained, the lessons he had learned, and the love he would carry with him forever. From the shell in his shirt pocket, he could still feel a phantom warmth where Tonto had pressed against him in those final moments. Not magic, but memory. Not power, but love.\nThe mark on his palm—the configuration from Tonto’s shell—had faded to become barely visible, The morning crowds began to pass by, commuters hurrying without noticing anything unusual, their faces etched with the mundane concerns of daily life. But Lukas saw differently now. He saw the way sunlight created halos around hurrying figures, the way the river’s surface reflected the sky in a constantly shifting mosaic, the magic hiding in plain sight in every ordinary moment. He saw the potential for kindness in every face, the hidden beauty in every corner of the city.\nHe turned toward home, ready at last to live in a world where real magic didn’t need cards or spells or alternate dimensions. It just needed open eyes and an open heart.\nAs he walked down the street, a bell tolled, its sound crisp and clear, belonging wholly to London. The air shimmered around him. The last of the morning mist curled around his ankles—ordinary fog with no trace of Arcanum’s shimmer. He could have sworn he felt a familiar presence beside him, not the weight of Tonto’s physical form but the warmth of his lasting influence, guiding him still.\nHe looked back one last time at the spot where Peter had stood, now just empty pavement in an ordinary London street. In his pocket, the small nub of chalk remained—a reminder that some questions were worth asking even without those perfect answers.\nLondon had never looked more extraordinary— The warmth of a beautiful morning radiated through his body as he noticed how the early sunlight caught the ripples of the river in geometric designs whilst Pigeons traced perfect arcs through the air that reminded him of the unnatural angles he’d witnessed in what felt akin to another world, countless times before.\nThe morning continued to unfold around him— traders setting up their stalls, early church bells calling to service, excited voices from the morning’s school run carrying on the soft breeze. Each moment was touched with its own kind of magic, and now Lukas could see both aspects simultaneously: the London that everyone saw and the Arcanum that had always existed alongside it. The bells rang with overtones only he could hear, and the light falling across the stalls revealed geometries that most would never notice.\nLukas walked on through his city changed not by magic but by love. He understood that London and Arcanum weren’t separate realms but different facets of the same reality, and the greatest magic was the courage to see this truth and to love deeply, even knowing that all things, eventually, come to an end.",
