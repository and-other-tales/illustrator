# Fonts Directory

This directory contains font files used by the application's UI.

## Missing Fonts

The application previously referenced `MundialLight.otf`, which was not available in the repository. The CSS has been updated to use 'Inter' and other web-safe fonts instead.

If you wish to use custom fonts:
1. Place the font files in this directory
2. Update the `custom.css` file to reference them properly
