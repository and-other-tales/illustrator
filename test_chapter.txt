The dark forest loomed before Alice, its ancient trees twisting toward a gray sky that seemed to press down upon her shoulders. She clutched the golden compass her grandmother had given her, feeling its warmth through her cold fingers. The path ahead disappeared into shadows that seemed to writhe and move with a life of their own.

"I must be brave," she whispered to herself, though her voice trembled with fear. The compass needle spun wildly for a moment before settling firmly toward the north, deeper into the woods where legend said the Crystal of Lost Dreams waited for someone pure of heart.

As she took her first step into the gloom, a magnificent silver wolf emerged from behind a massive oak. Its eyes gleamed with ancient wisdom, and when it spoke, its voice was like wind through autumn leaves.

"Little one," the wolf said, "you seek what many have died trying to find. Are you certain this is your path?"

Alice straightened her shoulders, meeting the wolf's penetrating gaze. "My village is dying without the crystal's magic. If there's even the smallest chance I can save them, I must try."

The wolf studied her for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "Courage like yours is rare. I will guide you, but know this - the forest will test your heart at every turn. Stay true to yourself, young Alice, no matter what illusions try to lead you astray."
