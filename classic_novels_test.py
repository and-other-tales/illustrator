Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it. 'And what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?' So she was considering in her own mind, as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her."""

'Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing‚Äîabsolutely nothing‚Äîhalf so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats,' said the Water Rat dreamily.

The high walls were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses, which were so thick that they made a little room, with the sky for a roof. The ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown, and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushes if they were alive."""

Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squeaking cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived."""
